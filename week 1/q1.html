    <h2>Whispers of the Night</h2>
    <p>
        Beneath the sky so wide and <strong>bright</strong>, <br>
        The stars are twinkling in the <strong>night</strong>. <br>
        A gentle breeze begins to <strong>blow</strong>, <br>
        Whispers secrets, soft and <strong>low</strong>. <br>
        <br>
        The moonlight dances on the <strong>sea</strong>, <br>
        A peaceful, timeless <strong>melody</strong>. <br>
        In every corner, dreams take <strong>flight</strong>, <br>
        As day surrenders to the <strong>night</strong>. <br>
    </p>
